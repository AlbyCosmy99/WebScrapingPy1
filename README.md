# startup.registroimprese.it Web Scraping

A Python project for automated **web scraping of Italian startups** from the official [Registro Imprese - Startup](https://startup.registroimprese.it/isin/home) portal.  
This script was built using **Selenium** and **undetected-chromedriver** to bypass bot detection and interact with dynamic content.
